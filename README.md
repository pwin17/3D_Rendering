3D Rendering for Online Cognitive Studies, a Technica Research Project

We have created 3 programs for an online cognitive study which requires participants to do mental rotation tasks.

required installations: Python 3.6, Vpython 7, pillow

The first program is an automated system which enable users to create 3D teteris models in desired angle rotation of desired axis(or axes).
To run the automated system: run 'bash automated'

The second program allows users to create a randomized 3D objects of desired size.
To run: 'python3 3drender.py'

The third program calculates the difficulty level of mental rotation tasks as some angles of rotation can be difficult(or even impossible) to mentally rotate the 3D model.
To run: 'python3 occlusion_calculator.py'
